# Learn Golang by unit testing
--------------------------------------
This project was born after my decision to learn Golang with [this tutorial](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)
.

In the past I started to learn Golang by doing a pet project, but after I gave up quickly because my efforts are bigger than my progress.


This tutorial is smart and it was born from an idea: "If the unit test are a part of documentation, why not they can be parto of the documentation to learn a language programming?"


The source code is divided by arguments by level: 
* you have a problem (Red)
* you have the first solution that teached you something (Green)
* you improve the initial solution (Blue)


## Features
The states are: [*O*] to do,  [*X*] done, [*N*] Next

### Fundamentals
* [X] hello world
* [X] Integer
* [X] Iteration
* [X] Array and slice
* [X] Strut method and interfaces
* [X] pointers 
* [N] Maps
* [O] Dependency Injection
* [O] Mocking
* [O] Concurrency
* [O] Select
* [O] Reflection
* [O] Sync
* [O] Context
* [O] Intro to property based tests
* [O] Maths

### Building and application

* [O] intro
* [O] http server
* [O] JSON, routing and embedded
* [O] IO and sorting
* [O] command line 
* [O] Time
* [O] websocket

### Q&A
* [O] OS Exec
* [O] Error Types
* [O] Context-aware Reader
* [O] Revisiting Http handlers

### After the tutorial

* [O]  write the documentation to every function of the project
* [O]  put the Feature in a table in Readme


## Status CI Integration
 
I use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
